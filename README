This is a simple php database interface
Functions commented with /**/ were not created but modified by me.

This is the database portion of a nice mvc template called
jpmaster77's login system, that is a very easy to expand upon system.
This was completely converted over to mysql pdo as of 2013

The references to keys in functions are to public keys stored in a 
database to facilitate bitcoin/litecoin/altcoin transactions.

Other functions are used for standard merchant functions
